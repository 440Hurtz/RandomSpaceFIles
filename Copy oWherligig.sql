Until the development of the first domed surface settlements, the sight of Kaywell was very rare, and it is so bright that many Mesbinite Kerbals prefer not to look at it. Hotter and brighter than the ancestral Sun Kerbol, Kaywell produces a lot of UV light, which can cause problems to unprotected vision and skin. Kaywell has two stellar companions: the distant cool red dwarf Gememma and the much closer red dwarf Limnel.',89700.0,1.011e+17,3.38e+28,2.256e+18,28.58924,224270.8,7.06666666667,'False','NULL','True','False',600000.0,0.15791,'5840.0','NULL','NULL','F-Type Main Sequence Star','NULL'),
    ('Limnel','Limnel was discovered by the first sungazing astronomer, Irgaster von Kerman, when he decided that it couldn''t be THAT bad if one stared into the Sun for a long period of time. He noticed that there seemed to be a bright spot on the limb of Kaywell, and dubbed it "The Limb of Kaywell," which was eventually shortened into Limnel. He went blind in his small eye, but using a telescope as a projector he was eventually able to take more precise measurements of Limnel, and published his findings in the scientific journal "Space And Some Things To Find In It." The revelation that Kaywell was actually two stars caused some fuss in the astronomical community, and it is still debated whether or not "Kaywell" refers to the pair of stars or to just the larger of the two. Limnel is also an M1Ve red dwarf flare star, periodically releasing bright UV flares which make it much brighter, and one of the earliest duties of the Space Program had been determining the space weather produced by the interacting magnetic fields of the two stars.',40400.0,2.051e+16,1.054e+28,7.036e+17,43.95826,186632.1,7.06666666667,'False','103950.0','True','False',600000.0,0.15791,'5840.0','NULL','Kaywell','M-Type Varibal Brightness Star','333422925.0'),

Its large radius and short orbital period make it easy to spot during transits, if you have protective sunglasses at least. If you blot Kaywell out with your thumb, you can usually see Shol as a bright star-like object nearby. Shol is, like Tyepolbynar, a gas giant, which are thought only to form in the outer solar system.

Its existence was firmly suspected after a terminally ill solar astronomer Bilburry Kerman detected a faint, tiny object transiting Kaywell. After calculating a possible trajectory, he marked it down in his book, noting that it was unlikely to transit Kaywell before he were to die. Many telescope cameras were burnt out searching for Bulburry''s asteroid, and occasionally it would be detected and lost again as its orbit could never be reasonably tracked. Finally, the mathematician Jinbat Kerman proved that all orbits that close to Shol would be at least a little bit chaotic, and found that Wolda was in a chaotic but dynamically stable orbit around Kaywell within the 9:5 mean motion resonance, and Bilburry was able to see his asteroid confirmed before he died unrelatedly to his illness in the tragedy of the Terrible Podbaston City Depressurization.',9.0,1018000000.0,7.141e+16,4766000.0,0.006,32.5,51.35,'False','40.0','False','False',0.0,0.0,'NULL','NULL','Kaywell','Asteriod','1849752580.0'),

It orbits very near Tyepolbynar in a circular orbit, implying that it formed alongside Tyepolbynar''s large moons, and therefore may be rocky. The planet''s name is the subject of vehement debate among the Mesbin Astronomical Society, with some Kerbals insisting the name be pronounced "Jif Gif" and others "Jif Jif."

Its orbit is very difficult to predict, but it appears unlikely to actually escape Tyepolbynar within the next few hundred years at least.

Because of the confusion involved, Vizea does not carry a satellite designation, but instead shares the Minor Planet Number "1." The two are considered a double minor planet. Considered a likely candidate for an original Protoplanet, Vizea may help answer the question of how the planets formed.',23.0,6648000000.0,1.943e+18,129700000.0,0.025,106.2,146.0,'True','910.0','False','False',0.0,0.0,'NULL','NULL','1 Wers','Miniterra','1822500.0'),

Its rotation period of 1,701 seconds is the fastest of any object in the solar system, and this allows it to be livable despite its incredible gravity. At the equator, its gravity is 1.29 gees. At the poles, the gravity is 13.24. The strange shape comes from the centrifugal force pushing material outward at the equator--and it is the centrifugal force that reduces equatorial gravity, not just the distance from the core. Mesbin was settled by a crashed colony ship: The U.S.C. Manifest Destiny, which came from the Kerbol System over 1660 Mesbin-years ago. Slowly building up their civilization within underground caverns and lava tubes and introducing a stable subterranean ecosystem was not easy, but as evident by our existence today, they succeeded.',1393.0,24370000000000.0,3.777e+24,252100000000000.0,13.25438,19027.0,0.4725,'False','571407.0','True','False',970000.0,1.0,'355.0','Hydrogen 94.45%, Helium 4%, Nitrogen 1%, Water 0.4%, Methane 0.1%, Carbon Dioxide 0.05%','Kaywell','Superterra','21759744400.0'),

As they approached its position, they realized that the mountain was detached from the horizon--it was floating! The explorers called it Aetheris Mons, the Sky Mountain. It never moves across the sky, always staying almost perfectly still above a specific spot on Mesbin''s surface. The terrain below Aetheris Mons was considered a mystical place for many years until physicists came up with an explanation for its apparent defying of gravity. Aetheris Mons turned out to be a moon of Mesbin, orbiting in a nearly perfect Mesbo-syncronous orbit. It was not actually still, it was orbiting Mesbin''s center at the same orbital period that Mesbin itself rotated, which just so happened to be only a few hundred kilometers high.',3.0,113100000.0,1.058e+16,706100.0,0.008,21.7,0.4725,'True','18.0','False','False',0.0,0.0,'NULL','NULL','Mesbin','Asteriod','2643404.49004706'),

This turned out to be an object orbiting in a 3:1 resonance with Mesbin''s rotation and Statmun''s orbit. Thresomin is a polarizing object for many astronomers and astronomy educators. When it was discovered, it was hailed as the fifth moon of Mesbin. However, around the same time, astronomers were discovering many, many small moonlets in orbits quite similar to Thresomin. Those moonlets, now understood to be a diffuse ring system left over from the destruction of Statmun''s compositional parent body, show similar spectral characteristics to Thresomin--rich in silicates and metals as well as hints of volatile ices.

They aptly named it the Kerbin Moon, or Kerbmun. The exploration and habitation of Kerbmun is a common staple of Science Fiction, and the notion of exploring the potentially life-bearing oceans of the planet gave rise to the subgenre of Gastronomical Fiction, exploring what types of amazing snack delicacies could be made if only Kerbals could find new and interesting species to eat!

It was incredibly frustrating for astronomers because at first, they could not consistently observe the satellite, and therefore could not conclusively prove its existence or calculate its orbit. One moment it would be there, then they''d come back after it had set and risen again to find it had disappeared! Having had enough of this mysterious ghost satellite, Durderry Galibash Barlennan the Third Kerman led an international team of astronomers from observatories all across Mesbin to observe Reander and look for Yawer, recording its position over time. This cooperation allowed astronomers to get a consistent observation arc across three Mesbin-Days. The result was that the satellite fades in and out over a time period of about 47 minutes. Getting a consistent observation arc allowed the astronomers to explain what was happening to the satellite, and to get a precise orbit, and Yawer was finally discovered. Being an international cooperation, the paper describing the discovery of Yawer has over 300 authors. Yawer was named for the Driddish word for "Blinker." The Blinking, of course, comes from a 47 minute rotation period--the second fastest in the system after Mesbin!--and a region of very dark terrain on one side. Yawer probably has an oblate shape similar to Mesbin, as it would be large enough to be spherical if it weren''t rotating.

Early Mesbin explorers would use it for longitudinal navigation, and get confused why they kept being led off course every few years after a correction to the star map was made. Annoyed by these constant navigation errors, navigator and early astronomer Gememma Kerman decided to measure the position of the star over time. What she found was startling. The star wasn''t just moving very quickly through deep space far away from Kaywell. It was moving at exactly the right angular rate to be in orbit around Kaywell at a distance just above that of Reander. She published her results in the scientific journal "Space And Some Things To Find In It" before being lynched by angry astrologers. The star turned out to be a red dwarf star in orbit of Kaywell after all, making Kaywell a double-star system. (Though it is now known that Kaywell is in fact a triple star!) The star was renamed Gememma''s Star (and Rodocer reidentified as a much more distant, dimmer star) and the gang of ravenous astrologers spent the rest of their lives in prison.',13800.0,2393000000000000.0,2.982e+27,1.99e+17,106.57899,169844.2,120.0,'False','186303939.0','True','False',600000.0,0.00987,'2800.0','NULL','Kaywell','M-Type Main Sequence Star','492000000000.0'),

Astronomer Annie Kerman monitored the light of Gememma with a photometer that was pointed at Gememma and left on a clock drive for several weeks. The data showed that, in addition to regular sunspots, occasional stellar flares, and occultations from Mesbin, the light curve showed something unexpected--little dips in the light for a few moments at a time, with a periodicity of about ten hours. At first she thought it was some strange variability cycle of the star. Much later, astronomer Crimmenon Kerman discovered that the dip in Annie''s light curves could be explained by a dwarf planet in a low orbit around Gememma. The planet carries the name Annie and Crimmenon''s Planet, but since that''s quite the mouthful and didn''t have the benefit of a popular science fiction novel canonizing the long name, the official nickname of "Ammenon" stuck.

However, when astronomers decided to actually go and check Gememma for the described planet, it was discovered by Giovan Kerman. Giovan was considered by the astronomical community to be the true discoverer of the planet, and was going to name the planet "Desch." However, Lowel sued Giovan, believing that he deserved discovery credit and naming rights. He lost the case, since he couldn''t prove that he had actually observed the object he claimed to observe.
